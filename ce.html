            Civil Engineers build the world’s infrastructure, which encompasses Railways, Highways, Bridges, Water-works, Skyscrapers, Canals, Wharves, Industrial Buildings, Rapid Transit Systems, and Power Plants etc. They deal with the design, construction, maintenance
            and repair of structures. There are opportunities galore for civil engineers, with new players entering the market and more large-scale developments announced around the globe. In CMR CET, the four-year B. Tech program of the Department is
            dedicated to delivering technically proficient and ethically responsible engineers to the society. Top notch laboratory resources are essential for the development of a modern day technocrat. The Department boasts of well equipped labs, manned
            by highly competent staff. The various laboratories that come under the purview of the Department of Civil Engineering are Strength of Materials Lab, Hydraulics Lab, Survey Lab, Geotechnical Engineering Lab, Concrete Lab, Computer Aided Design
            (CAD) Lab and Transportation Engineering Lab Our Vision “To evolve as a centre of academic excellence and advanced research in Civil engineering and related areas.” Our Mission 1. To impart quality education and prepare the students to become
            competent for the global market and equip them for the pursuit of higher education. 2. To encourage students to contribute towards solving social issues and promote research. 3. Develop leadership qualities and professional ethics in students
