            The EEE Department is dedicated to delivering competent electrical engineers to the arena of the real world. They are outfitted with core technical knowledge as well as professional skills necessary to face the challenges of the future.The faculty and
            staff are fully committed to gear up towards this end. There is a Native American saying that goes, ‘Tell me, and I’ll forget. Show me, and I may not remember. Involve me, and I’ll understand.’ The above statement underscores the importance
            of Industrial Visits, in the engineering curriculum. The department arranges industrial visits to reputed establishments in and around the state, with a view to integrate academic instructions and practical aspects. Excellent laboratories
            have been laid out for the practical instruction of students. These add value to the theoretical instruction gleaned in the lecture halls. The Machines lab, Measurement Lab, Digital and Electronics Lab, Control and Power Electronics Lab (UG
            & PG), Power Systems Simulation Lab, Electrical Workshop, Electrical Model Lab totaling 1000 sq.m are manned by competent staff. MATLAB, MiPower and PSCAD software has been installed in the Power Systems Simulation Lab. The department has
            qualified and dedicated faculty members with Ph.D & M.Tech qualification and is instrumental in building the career of the students. Our Vision “To produce globally competitive engineering graduates and become center of excellence through
            research in the areas of Electrical & Electronics Engineering.” Our Mission • To impart quality and contemporary education in the realm of Electrical & electronics engineering. • To pursue research and new technologies in Electrical & Electronics
            Engineering and related disciplines in order to serve the needs of the society..
